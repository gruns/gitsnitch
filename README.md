# GitSnitch

`gitsnitch` is a simple tool that finds and prints a GitHub user's email
address(es). Give `gitsnitch` a GitHub username or profile URL, like
gruns or https://github.com/gruns, and it finds and prints that user's
email addresses by examining the commits across that user's GitHub
repos.

This gitsnitch repo is private, and not (yet) published to PyPi, because
GitHub likely doesn't want this type of tool to be public nor
notorious. That is, they almost certainly don't want developer's emails
to be easily exfiltrated from GitHub. Doubly so via their API.

### Usage

To use, provide `gitsnitch` with a GitHub username or profile URL and
let it go to work. `gitsnitch` will, in turn:

  1. Get a list of that user's repos via the GitHub API.
  2. Iterate through each of those repos, prioritizing non-forked repos
     are forked repos.
  3. For each repo, iterate through that repo's commits via the GitHub
     API and examine the committers' email addresses.
  4. Collate a list of each repo's committers and, notably, their
     email addresses.
  5. Output a nicely formatted summary of committers and their email
     addresses, sorted by number of commits.

Example:

```shell
$ gitsnitch https://github.com/gruns
https://github.com/gruns/autokey-to-espanso
Ansgar Grunseid  grunseid@gmail.com  2 commits, latest on Jan 07, 2023

https://github.com/gruns/furl
Ansgar Grunseid  grunseid@gmail.com   23 commits, latest on Jun 28, 2022
Ben Greiner      code@bnavigator.de    3 commits, latest on Mar 29, 2021
Tim Gates        tim.gates@iress.com   1 commits, latest on Jul 30, 2022

https://github.com/gruns/fallout-sonora-translation
Ansgar Grunseid  grunseid@gmail.com  7 commits, latest on Sep 22, 2023

...
```

That's it. Simple.

By default, this script does not need a GitHub API token because GitHub
API endpoints, like https://api.github.com/users/gruns/repos, can be
accessed without an API token at a low rate limit. However, if you
encounter API limits, eg

```python
Exception: Error fetching repositories: {"message":"API rate limit
exceeded for xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx. (But here's the good news:
Authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. Check out the
documentation for more details.)", "documentation_url":
"https://docs.github.com/rest/..."}
```

you'll need to create an API token and add it your environment. To
create an API token for `gitsnitch`:

   1. Go to https://github.com/ and log in to your account.
   2. Click on your profile picture (top-right corner) and go to 'Settings'.
   3. Click 'Developer settings' in the left-hand sidebar.
   4. Under 'Developer settings', click 'Personal access
      tokens'->'Tokens (classic)'.
   5. Click 'Generate new token'. Then select at least 'read:user' and
      'user:email' under 'user'.
   6. Click 'Generate token'.
   7. Copy the generated token. Be sure to save it; you won't be able
      to view it again.

Then add this token to your environment with

```shell
export GITHUB_TOKEN=<your_api_token>
```

Then re-run `gitsnitch` as normal. Boom.
